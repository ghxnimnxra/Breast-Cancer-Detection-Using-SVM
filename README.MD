# Breast Cancer Dataset Detection Using Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM(SVC)) 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for breast cancer detection in this study is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, created by Dr. William H. Wolberg. It consists of fluid samples from patients with solid breast masses, where cytological features were analysed using a graphical program called Xcyt.
The dataset contains 30 real-valued features derived from each cell nucleus in the samples. These features include measurements such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The mean, extreme value, and standard error represent each feature.
The primary goal is to classify the samples as malignant (M) or benign (B). There are 569 instances, each associated with an ID number and the diagnosis (either malignant or benign). This dataset is widely used in machine learning to train models that can predict whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on these 30 features.
